# Sortacle Sustainability Dashboard (with Gemini)

A beautifully modernized and stylized frontend for the Sortacle project, designed with a focus on sustainability, AI-driven sorting, and data visualization.

## 🌿 Design Language

- **Sustainability Themed**: A refined color palette of deep forest greens, emerald accents, and soft mint backgrounds.
- **Modern Typography**: Features 'Plus Jakarta Sans' for readability and 'Fraunces' for an elegant, editorial feel.
- **Glassmorphism**: A sleek, translucent sidebar with backdrop blurring for a high-end application feel.
- **Micro-interactions**: Smooth transitions between tabs and subtle animations on cards and icons.

## 🚀 Interactive Sections

- **Overview**: High-level impact metrics (Items Sorted, Tons Diverted, Precision).
- **Heatmaps**: Geospatial mapping of material flows through the inference network.
- **Real-time**: Live telemetry and inference stream analysis (latency, data ingest).
- **Sponsor Portal**: Transparent ESG reporting for strategic project partners.
